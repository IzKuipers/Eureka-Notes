# EUREKA
A very utilitarian note taking application, designed to consolidate the hundreds of text documents I keep in random places into one centralized web application that I can access from anywhere. It's got users, it's got notes, what more do you need?

> [!WARNING]
> This project is in its early stages. So early in fact, there's no subdomain, no deployment, not even 50% of the backend, not even 0% of the frontend. It'll be awhile before it's production ready. View the figma here:

## Contributing
If you see something in the code that doesn't look quite right, feel free to contribute. The issues section is also the perfect place for bugs and things you want added, though I won't defer very far from the original semi-simplistic utilitarian vibe. All contributions are welcome!
